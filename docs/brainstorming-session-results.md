- Circular economy principles driving both environmental and economic value

## Technique Sessions

### Ecosystem Mapping - 15 minutes

**Description:** Mapped complete automobile lifecycle in market to identify value creation opportunities

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Vehicle lifecycle stages: 0-100K km (maintenance), 100K-300K km (secondary market), 300K+ km (scrap threshold)
2. Critical transition points where parts marketplace creates maximum value
3. Accident vehicles as immediate parts extraction opportunity regardless of age/mileage
4. Regular maintenance patterns creating predictable demand cycles
5. Insurance total-loss decisions creating supply of functional components

**Insights Discovered:**
- Two primary market inefficiencies: accident vehicle waste and heavy maintenance cost barriers
- Market follows predictable patterns: maintenance every 20K km, heavy maintenance at 100K+ km
- Economic threshold at 300K km/15 years creates systematic supply of parts for extraction

**Notable Connections:**
- Accident vehicles provide immediate supply while high-mileage vehicles create predictable demand
- OEM parts cost 4x used alternatives, creating significant value opportunity for buyers

### Stakeholder Deep Dive - 20 minutes  

**Description:** Identified and analyzed all potential user types with distinct needs and behaviors in automobile parts ecosystem

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Individual Sellers: Brand/Model specific, low quantity, one-time transactions
2. Individual Buyers: Brand/Model specific, cost-driven, precision requirements
3. Industrial Sellers: Product-specific, high volume, business operations focus  
4. Industrial Buyers: Product-specific, bulk purchasing, reliability requirements
5. Cross-market opportunities between working parts and broken parts for remanufacturing

**Insights Discovered:**
- Clear distinction between Brand/Model specificity (individuals) vs Product specificity (industrial)
- Industrial users have fundamentally different search and volume behaviors
- Repair shops need broken parts for remanufacturing, creating circular economy opportunity

**Notable Connections:**
- Individual sellers' accident vehicles supply exactly what industrial buyers need for remanufacturing
- Cost-sensitive individual buyers create demand for parts that industrial sellers extract systematically

### Feature Innovation Through Scenarios - 25 minutes

**Description:** Developed specific real-world scenarios to identify most impactful platform features

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Wanted listing system with instant notifications to relevant sellers
2. Reference-code based part identification for precise matching
3. AI visual recognition to identify parts from photographs
4. Vehicle compatibility mapping from reference codes to target notifications
5. Trust system with banning mechanism for quality control
6. Scrap vehicle listings for systematic parts extraction

**Insights Discovered:**
- Reference codes solve the precision matching problem that general marketplaces can't address
- Notification system creates immediate value for industrial sellers by showing demand
- AI integration reduces barriers for non-technical users while maintaining precision

**Notable Connections:**
- Wanted listings + instant notifications + AI compatibility mapping form inseparable core system
- Trust system essential for marketplace credibility in high-value automotive parts transactions

### AI Integration Opportunities - 15 minutes

**Description:** Explored where artificial intelligence could solve problems humans cannot efficiently handle

**Ideas Generated:**
1. AI Module 1: Image recognition to extract reference codes from photographs
2. AI Module 2: Reference code to vehicle compatibility mapping for notification targeting
3. Deep research validation of reference codes with websearch

**Insights Discovered:**
- AI creates bidirectional intelligence: visual → reference codes → vehicle compatibility
- Two-phase AI approach solves both technical barriers (code identification) and business barriers (relevant matching)
- AI enables non-technical users to participate in precision-based marketplace

**Notable Connections:**
- Visual recognition connects casual users to precise reference-code system
- Compatibility mapping ensures notifications reach only relevant sellers, reducing spam

### Business Model Exploration - 20 minutes

**Description:** Identified sustainable revenue streams based on value creation for different user types

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Industrial seller notification services (subscription model)
2. Rare parts access fees (success-based revenue)  
3. AI-enhanced listing services (per-use pricing)
4. Premium search and filtering capabilities
5. Data and analytics services for automotive businesses
6. Partnership revenue sharing with photographers and logistics providers

**Insights Discovered:**
- Two primary value propositions: instant demand visibility for sellers, rare parts access for buyers
- Subscription model aligns with industrial seller business operations and ROI calculations
- Success fees work for buyers because they only pay when finding otherwise unavailable parts

**Notable Connections:**
- Industrial sellers willing to pay for notifications because each notification has ~25% conversion rate
- Buyers willing to pay access fees because parts savings (50-75% vs OEM) far exceed platform costs

### Implementation Strategy - 25 minutes

**Description:** Defined strategic priorities and development sequence for sustainable platform launch

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Wanted listings + AI compatibility mapping as minimum viable system (inseparable components)
2. Industrial seller partnership approach for supply-side acquisition
3. Automotive enthusiast community targeting for demand-side growth
4. Phase 1: Core systems, Phase 2: AI enhancement, Phase 3: Scale optimization
5. Break-even projections: 70,000 TL/month revenue target by Month 7-8
6. Market focus initially with regional expansion planning for Year 2-3

**Insights Discovered:**
- Core system components cannot be built separately - wanted listings require AI for effective notifications
- Supply-side acquisition (industrial sellers) must precede demand-side to ensure inventory availability
- Financial sustainability achievable within 8 months with focused user acquisition strategy

**Notable Connections:**
- Technical architecture dependencies align with business model priorities
- Customer acquisition sequence (industrial sellers first) matches revenue stream timing requirements
