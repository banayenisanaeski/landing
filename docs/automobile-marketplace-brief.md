# Executive Project Brief: Automobile Parts Marketplace
**BanaYeni SanaEski - Strategic Evolution**

**Project:** Automobile Parts & Scrap Vehicle Marketplace  
**Created:** August 7, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0 - Strategic Pivot  
**Status:** Architecture Planning Phase  

## Executive Summary

BanaYeni SanaEski has evolved into a **specialized automobile parts marketplace** focused exclusively on connecting spare parts buyers with sellers in the Turkish market. The platform addresses critical inefficiencies in automobile parts sourcing through a reference-code based matching system enhanced by AI integration.

**Core Value Exchange:**
- **Sellers:** Monetize valuable parts from scrap vehicles and accident-damaged automobiles that would otherwise be wasted
- **Buyers:** Access rare, hard-to-find parts at significant cost savings compared to OEM alternatives (up to 75% savings)
- **Result:** Circular economy creation where functional parts get second life while enabling cost-effective vehicle maintenance

**Strategic Focus:** Reference-based part identification with notification system, powered by AI for visual recognition and vehicle compatibility mapping.

## Problem Statement

**Primary Market Inefficiencies:**

**1. Accident Vehicle Waste**
- Cars with exterior damage but valuable interior/engine components are scrapped entirely
- No systematic way to extract and monetize functional parts before disposal
- Significant value destruction in working components

**2. Heavy Maintenance Cost Barriers**  
- OEM parts for vehicles with 100K+ km cost 4x compared to used alternatives
- Difficult to source specific parts for older vehicle models (300K+ km / 15+ years)
- Limited access to rare or discontinued components

**3. Supply-Demand Disconnect**
- Industrial scrapyards have no inventory visibility system
- Individual sellers cannot efficiently reach relevant buyers
- Repair shops needing broken parts for remanufacturing have no sourcing medium

## Proposed Solution

**Reference-Code Based Automobile Parts Marketplace**

A specialized platform enabling precise part matching through automotive reference codes, enhanced by AI-powered identification and notification systems.

**Core Solution Components:**

**1. Wanted Listing System with Notifications**
- Buyers create wanted listings using part reference codes OR brand/model specifications
- Industrial sellers automatically notified when matching parts are requested
- AI-powered vehicle compatibility mapping from reference codes

**2. Reference-Based Part Identification**
- Every automotive part identified by manufacturer reference codes
- AI visual recognition to identify reference codes from images  
- Deep research validation to ensure accuracy and prevent fraud

**3. Dual Listing Architecture**
- **Scrap Vehicle Listings:** Industrial sellers list entire vehicles for dismantling (brand/model/year)
- **Individual Part Listings:** Specific components with reference codes and condition status

**4. AI-Enhanced Matching Intelligence**
- **AI Module 1:** Image recognition → Reference code identification and validation
- **AI Module 2:** Reference code → Vehicle/brand compatibility mapping for optimal notifications

## Target User Segments

**Individual Sellers**
- **Profile:** Car owners with accident-damaged or high-mileage vehicles
- **Need:** Monetize valuable parts before scrapping entire vehicle
- **Search Behavior:** Brand/Model specific listings
- **Volume:** Low quantity, specific parts

**Individual Buyers**
- **Profile:** Car owners needing parts for maintenance of 100K+ km vehicles  
- **Need:** Cost-effective alternatives to expensive OEM parts
- **Search Behavior:** Brand/Model specific requirements
- **Volume:** Single parts or small quantities

**Industrial Sellers**
- **Profile:** Scrapyards, dismantling centers, accident recovery businesses
- **Need:** Better margins selling parts individually vs. bulk scrap metal
- **Search Behavior:** Product/component type focused, less brand-specific
- **Volume:** High quantity, multiple vehicle dismantling

**Industrial Buyers**
- **Profile:** Auto repair shops, remanufacturing companies, engine specialists
- **Need:** Steady supply of both working and broken parts for refurbishment
- **Search Behavior:** Product-specific, functional requirements over brand matching
- **Volume:** Bulk purchasing for business operations

## Technical Architecture

**Core Systems Architecture:**

**1. Reference Database Integration**
- Comprehensive automotive parts reference code database
- Brand/model/year compatibility matrices
- Part condition categorization system

**2. AI Integration Modules**
- **Visual Recognition Engine:** Image-to-reference-code identification
- **Validation System:** Cross-reference verification and accuracy checking
- **Compatibility Engine:** Reference-code-to-vehicle mapping for notifications

**3. Notification & Matching System**
- Real-time wanted listing creation triggers
- Automated seller notifications based on inventory matching
- Smart filtering for relevant matches only

**4. Trust & Quality Control**
- User verification and rating system
- Incorrect listing detection and automatic banning
- Photo-based condition verification

## Business Model

**Revenue Streams:**

**Primary Monetization:**
1. **Industrial Seller Notification Fees:** Premium service for instant alerts when parts are requested
2. **Rare Parts Access Fees:** Buyers pay premium for access to hard-to-find components(Has to be build upon finding material)

**Value-Based Pricing:**
- Industrial sellers save marketing costs and get immediate demand visibility
- Buyers save 50-75% compared to OEM while accessing otherwise unavailable parts

**Free Services (Platform Growth):**
- Basic listing creation for individual users
- Standard search functionality
- Basic messaging between buyers and sellers

## MVP Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Core Systems (Months 1-2)**
- Wanted listing system with basic notification triggers
- Reference code database integration
- AI Module 1: Basic image recognition for reference codes

**Phase 2: AI Enhancement (Month 3)**  
- AI Module 2: Reference-to-vehicle compatibility mapping
- Advanced notification filtering and relevance optimization
- Trust system with user verification

**Phase 3: Scale & Optimize (Month 4+)**
- Industrial seller premium features
- Advanced analytics for supply/demand insights
- Mobile application development

**Minimum Viable System Dependencies:**
- Wanted listings +  notifications (inseparable components)
- AI reference mapping (required for accurate notifications)
- Basic trust/verification system (essential for marketplace credibility)

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- AI accuracy for market automotive parts → Partner with local automotive database providers(needed to be search through deepresearch)
- Notification system scaling → Cloud-based infrastructure with auto-scaling

**Business Risks:**  
- Industrial seller adoption → Start with pilot partnerships with major scrapyards
- Quality control at scale → Automated detection plus community reporting system

## Strategic Differentiation

**Unique Market Position:**
1. **Reference-Code Precision:** Unlike general classifieds, enables exact part matching
2. **AI-Enhanced Discovery:** Visual recognition eliminates manual reference lookup
3. **Demand Notification:** Industrial sellers know when parts are wanted
4. **Circular Economy Focus:** Specifically designed for parts extraction and reuse

**Competitive Advantages:**
- First-mover advantage in AI-powered automotive parts matching in Turkey
- Network effects through notification system create increasing platform value
- High switching costs once reference database and AI matching become established
