# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The platform delivers a trust-first, efficiency-focused experience that bridges the technical gap between professional automotive users and individual sellers/buyers. The interface emphasizes visual communication through photos over technical jargon, with AI assistance seamlessly integrated to handle reference code complexities. The design philosophy centers on reducing friction in the listing and matching process while building confidence through transparency and social proof.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex features like reference codes are hidden from casual users but readily available for professionals
- **Visual-First Listings:** Photos are primary, with technical details supporting rather than leading
- **Instant Gratification:** Real-time notifications and immediate chat access create momentum in transactions
- **Guided Flows:** Step-by-step processes for listing creation with AI assistance at friction points
- **Trust Indicators:** Seller ratings, verification badges, and transaction history visible throughout

## Core Screens and Views

- **Home/Search Screen** - Combined search and browse interface with quick filters for parts vs vehicles
- **Listing Creation Wizard** - Separate flows for vehicles (simple) vs parts (detailed with AI assistance)  
- **Wanted Listing Creation** - Smart form that adapts based on user knowledge (reference code vs vehicle selection)
- **Notification Center** - Real-time updates on matches with direct actions to view listing or start chat
- **Chat Interface** - In-app messaging with photo sharing and quick actions for price negotiation
- **Seller Dashboard** - Analytics, inventory management, and notification preferences for industrial users
- **Part Details Page** - Photos gallery, specifications, seller info, and prominent contact actions
- **My Listings** - Management interface for active listings, with edit/pause/delete capabilities

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

## Branding

Clean, professional automotive aesthetic with trust-building elements. Color palette should convey reliability and technical competence while remaining approachable for non-technical users. Visual hierarchy emphasizes photos and key information (price, location, condition) over technical specifications.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive, and all mobile platforms
