# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable cost-effective automobile maintenance by connecting spare parts buyers with sellers through AI-enhanced reference-code matching
- Monetize valuable parts from accident-damaged and scrap vehicles that would otherwise be wasted
- Create supply-demand connections through targeted notifications to reduce inventory holding costs for sellers
- Provide access to rare and hard-to-find automotive parts at 50-75% savings compared to OEM alternatives
- Establish market leadership in AI-powered automotive parts matching in the Turkish market
- Build a sustainable circular economy platform that generates revenue through dual-value monetization

## Background Context

BanaYeni SanaEski addresses critical inefficiencies in the automobile parts market where functional components from accident-damaged vehicles are scrapped entirely, and owners of vehicles with 100K+ km face prohibitive OEM part costs. The platform leverages AI-powered visual recognition and vehicle compatibility mapping to create a specialized marketplace that connects buyers needing specific parts with sellers who have matching inventory. By focusing on reference-code precision and instant notification systems, the platform creates immediate value for both industrial sellers (scrapyards) who gain demand visibility and individual buyers who access otherwise unavailable parts at significant cost savings.
