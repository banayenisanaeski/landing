# BanaYeni SanaEski - Complete Project Documentation

**Turkish Sustainable Parts Marketplace**  
*Comprehensive documentation covering business strategy, technical architecture, and implementation guides*

---

## 📋 Documentation Overview

This documentation covers every aspect of the BanaYeni SanaEski project, from initial business strategy through complete technical implementation. The project represents a migration from a dual-database architecture to a streamlined Supabase-only solution optimized for the Turkish automotive parts market.

## 🎯 Project Context

**BanaYeni SanaEski** ("Old2You, New2Me") is a Turkish digital marketplace connecting automotive and machinery parts buyers with sellers, promoting circular economy principles. The platform serves as an "online junkyard" where users can find rare/discontinued parts and sell unused/broken parts for repair rather than scrapping.

**Key Business Model:**
- **Revenue Strategy:** Google Ads traffic monetization
- **Core Feature:** Interest-gated communication system
- **Market Focus:** Turkish automotive/machinery parts
- **Migration Goal:** Dual-database to Supabase-only architecture
