## Performance and Scalability Considerations

### Development Performance

#### 16. Performance-Driven Development
```typescript
interface PerformanceDrivenDevelopment {
  developmentPerformance: {
    buildTime: {
      target: "< 2 minutes for full build";
      optimization: [
        "Incremental TypeScript compilation",
        "Optimized Next.js build configuration",
        "Efficient dependency management",
        "Parallel testing execution"
      ];
    };
    
    testExecution: {
      target: "< 5 minutes for full test suite";
      optimization: [
        "Test parallelization",
        "Optimized test data generation",
        "Efficient Turkish text testing",
        "Selective test execution"
      ];
    };
    
    developmentFeedback: {
      target: "< 30 seconds for development server reload";
      optimization: [
        "Hot module replacement",
        "Optimized development dependencies",
        "Efficient Turkish localization loading",
        "Development-specific performance settings"
      ];
    };
  };
  
  applicationPerformance: {
    turkishMobileOptimization: {
      target: "< 3 seconds initial load on 3G Turkish networks";
      strategies: [
        "Aggressive code splitting",
        "Image optimization for Turkish users",
        "Turkish text processing optimization",
        "Mobile-first asset delivery"
      ];
    };
    
    searchPerformance: {
      target: "< 200ms Turkish text search response";
      implementation: [
        "PostgreSQL trigram indexing",
        "Search result caching",
        "Optimized Turkish character processing",
        "Efficient database query optimization"
      ];
